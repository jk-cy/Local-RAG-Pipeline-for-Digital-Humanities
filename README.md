# Project Title: Enhanced Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

This project extends the foundational work in [mrdbourke/simple-local-rag](https://github.com/mrdbourke/simple-local-rag) with additional enhancements to streamline the RAG pipeline. These modifications aim to improve usability, accuracy, and adaptability for those engaging in retrieval-based text generation and semantic search, particularly with a focus on document and literary analysis. The RAG can be further applied to teaching and learning in general, and of digital humanities specifically in this context.

## Key Enhancements in This Edition

### 1. **Pipeline Adaptations for Literary Analysis**
   - **Focus on Context Windows and Token Limits**: Added functionality to manage LLM token limits and context windows, which is especially useful for longer literary texts. This enhancement facilitates the use of RAG for close reading and analysis of literature, allowing models to capture context-rich nuances in literary data.
   - **Reminders and Notes for Tokenization**: Included notes on the significance of tokenization and context window size for LLMs, helping users optimize input and prevent information loss in token processing.

### 2. **User-Focused Documentation and Code Modularity**
   - **Beginner-Friendly Organization**: Reorganized code cells and added inline comments to make the pipeline accessible to users at various skill levels, with a particular focus on beginners.
   - **Clear Code Separation for Debugging**: Structured code to allow for easier identification and isolation of errors, with dedicated sections for embedding, query processing, and retrieval.
   - **Detailed Explanations and Practical Tips**: Added practical usage notes throughout the pipeline to help users understand and modify the retrieval process, particularly beneficial for those implementing this in document-heavy or research-focused projects.

## Project Based On

This project is modified from [mrdbourke/simple-local-rag](https://github.com/mrdbourke/simple-local-rag) and includes additional changes and notes focused on enhancing the RAG pipelineâ€™s functionality for document analysis and literary research.

## Usage and Application

This enhanced RAG pipeline is ideal for research tasks that require detailed document analysis and retrieval, such as:
- **Semantic Search in Document Archives**: Quickly locate relevant sections within extensive document collections.
- **Literary Analysis**: Conduct close reading and cross-referencing of literary works with contextual embeddings.
